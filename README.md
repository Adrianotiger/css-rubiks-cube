CSS Rubik's Cube
================

This is a 3D Rubik's Cube made with CSS3.

As the application uses advanced features from CSS3, some browsers will not be capable to support this application. The newest version of Chrome should be sufficient as the application was developed using Chrome.

CSS3 is extensively used, especially 3D transformations and transitions (animations).

JavaScript is used for generating sequence of random moves, and to add/remove classes to/from appropriate elements in order to trigger animations.
